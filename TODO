Add in some automation to the testing to make it more like the elixir koans

Look at fsnotify for the monitoring of file saving then import the test and catch any errors, display them but keep running

End goal is similar to the elixir ones, with a better file structure and stuff

Maybe I can make the whole thing just more efficient as well?
